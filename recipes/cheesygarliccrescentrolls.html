    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesy Garlic Crescent Rolls Recipe is great with pasta or as an appetizer served with warm pasta sauce. Ready to eat in 20 minutes. Super quick recipe!</p>
    <p>These rolls only have a couple of ingredients and can cook alongside the pasta casserole. Crescent rolls, string cheese, melted butter, and garlic bread seasoning. I had the rolls ready to bake before the oven had even preheated. SO quick and easy!</p>
